# Introduction
Liver disease is a significant public health issue globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict liver disease using a dataset of patient records. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

# Model
Several models have been explored for Liver Disease Prediction, including:

* DecisionTree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Artificial Neural Network

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osama-Anmar/Liver-Disease-Preadiction.git
cd Liver-Disease-Preadiction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
```bash
jupyter notebook LiverDiseasePrediction.ipynb
```
